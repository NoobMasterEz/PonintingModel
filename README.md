# Pointing Model NARIS

Accurate pointing or positioning of a telescope is a common goal of any telescopic system that wishes to be productive. All motorized telescopes can be characterized by some
  coordinate system that is native to their axes of motion and are (re)positioned with motors.
Unfortunately, it is arbitrarily difficult to make the mechanical system match any celestial
coordinate system. Before the advent of computers, the precision of pointing and tracking
was limited by the alignment of the mechanical system to the celestial sphere. Now that
substantial computing power exists to control and operate telescopes
